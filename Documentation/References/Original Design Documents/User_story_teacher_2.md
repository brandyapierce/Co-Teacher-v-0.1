I wake up in the morning and I check my CoTeacher app that I colloquially refer to simply as, "my CoTeacher". The calming UX welcomes me and wishes me a good morning. It shows me a summary of our previous evening's plans that we developed for today, based on our school year plan and modified based on recent data, trends, assessments and observations on differentiated learning opportunities. The community section is lively with discussions around a new STEM activity that kids are going nuts for. there is a github/hugging face-like repository for lessons and activities and their results and feedback from students, parents and teachers. I am particularly interested in the "bright Ideas spotlight", highlighting the most viral lessons and activities. I tell the app that I want to incorporate it into my curriculum and it adds it to my favorites or another user defined list. My CoTeacher finds the most appropriate place to add it into my curriculum and suggests adjustments based on students' preferences and needs. I look up my submissions and see my most recent one is getting a lot of feedback and inspiring some super interesting remixes. Before leaving my house, I take a look at a list of materials I'm going to need today along with notes that have been gleaned from chats and parent Google calendars that have opted in. 2 students are on vacation and one student has a birthday today. My Coteacher has already reminded parents to pack something appropriate if they do not want their child eating cake or whatnot. My CoTeacher also shows me what items for todays lessons have been donated by parents and what is still needed. if applicable. Otherwise, MyCoteacher is integrated into the school's admin system and they know exactly what to stage where from the resource room before the day starts. I'm running late due to an accident. MyCoteacher suspects I'm going to be late and asks if it should find a teacher to cover my class to ensure it meets state mandated ratios until I make it in. I select yes. The floater, already in the building, is messaged that she will have to be in my room from 8:00 until my ETA at 8:12 I enter my classroom as my students are getting their tablets and being greeted by their favorite characters verbally asking them about their morning and assessing their speech, verbal comprehension, mood, attention and focus. I grab my tablet and it's rapidly populating data from the morning, including roll - who's here and what is their status as determined by the good morning assessment The timer for the first activity is counting down and at about 2:00. The childrens' tablets are organizing the kids to common groups as determined by k means clustering algorithms that have determined the most optimized group makeups and locations and is steering them there and giving them achievements for arriving at their group station quickly. One station has small group of kids working on tracing letters with their fingers. another one has students that have mastered finger tracing and is working on styling writing. There are a couple of students that have mastered stylus writing and are already playing gamified keyboard learning games. My tablet is lighting up with data and insights, "Bobby is having a hard time focusing on his tasks today", "Megan is making particularly impressive progress with her stylus writing.", "Charlie's writing and reading patterns appear to be trending toward alignment with Dyslexia, here are some suggestions for resources and referrals for screening. And here are some suggestions for differentiated learning for Charlie, would you like me to add it to his learning plan/profile?" It looks like the read receipt shows his parents have seen Charlie's notification already and are already in the process of scheduling screening. They have also used their fingerprint reader/ 2 factor authentication to approve charlie's field trip release digitally. The app coordinates and orchestrates the classroom throughout the day and gives me insights into my students and great suggestions of how to maximize on learning opportunities that are in alignment with their optimal learning modality as designed based on the results of perhaps years of a/b testing lessons and student happiness and progress data. I am free to walk the classroom, checking my CoTeacher app for interesting insights, opportunities and communications., focusing on my students and joining in on the fun and discovery and sharing my experience and expertise. A notice chimes and lets me know that we have a couple of minutes to wrap up our current stations and I need to prepare for the next one. I prepare one station and clear another per my CoTeachers' suggestions. After a few rotations, as children are finishing up, they're putting their tablets away and lining up for recess. My tablet chimes to show me who's in line and ready to go out to recess. I help everyone else finish up what they're doing and get in line. I check with my CoTeacher to make sure everyone is accounted for. As I look at the screen, the camera on the opposite side is using facial recognition to recognize each child and verifies they are in line. As they exit the door and go to the playground, my CoTeacher tracks every child to make sure they all exit and uses my tablet to update their physical location in the system. Bobby has to go home. The office knows exactly where we are and are able to come let me know, since I missed the notification on the application when I put down my tablet for a moment. We go through the same process as the kids come back in. They grab their tablets and go through their menu for lunch, which guides them to food options that maximize the child's preferences, dietary requirements, cultural sensitivities and optimal nutrition. The lunchroom gets an exact count of how much of what to prepare and orchestrates the preparation, timing and delivery. The kids mostly get what they want and eat the majority of their food. Their tablets record what was eaten and is able to determine the exact nutritional content that the child consumed. As the day goes on, assessments and datapoints are being sown into and gleaned from the day. A centralized server is crunching Ai and ML algorithms and RPA processes and facilitating lunchtime conversations between older kids and their parents. At the end of the day, My CoTeacher app is coming up with communications and summaries for the day, and coming up with insights and suggestions for the next day. we agree upon our directions and individualized instruction plans, materials, etc... A Parent-Controlled “Digital Twin” of the Child’s Data is updated with everything learned from the day. All logs and documentation needs are updated and admin logs and paperwork are updated and sent via RPA to meet regulations. The tokens that allowed the school to use the children's scoped data expires as the child is picked up from school. I check in with My Coteacher app in bed before I go to sleep and check in on conversations, ideas and concerns from Admin and Charlie's mother. She has all of my logs and observations and wants to go over his behavior. We have numerous video, photo and data evidence to support my observations. She clearly just needed to vent, luckily, I am covered with all of this documentation. My job is safe and Charlie's parents are now focused on getting Charlie the appropriate resources. I also see all of my achievements and my students' achievements and beam with pride at my position atop the leaderboard for neurodiversity inclusive lessons that resulted in greater than expected progress and feelings of happiness from my students. The data will be used to further inform other teachers and document my achievements. I also like to look through some of my student's portfolios as well as my own portfolio that I need to keep for my teacher certification. My CoTeacher has recorded, analyzed, assessed and organized my achievements for the day as it updates all of our portfolios and profiles.
