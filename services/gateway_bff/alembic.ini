# Alembic migration environment script
# This is a placeholder for migration management

"""Alembic configuration and helper file.

This file is generated when you first set up Alembic for a SQLAlchemy project.
For now, we're using SQLAlchemy's metadata.create_all() for schema management.

To enable full migration support, run:
  alembic init alembic
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
  alembic upgrade head
